    "| Matrix-vector product | Sum of products | Avos sum of avos products |\n",
    "| Matrix multiplication | Row × column dot products | Row × column avos products |\n",
    "| Transitive closure | $A^* = I + A + A^2 + ...$ | $R^+ = R \\otimes R \\otimes ... $ (converges in ≤n steps) |\n",

    "| Linear independence | Zero combination test | Modified (see below) |\n",
    "| Rank | Dimension of column space | Number of independent ancestry lines |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Independence in Avos Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear independence **does apply**, but with interesting properties due to the nature of avos_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Definition (Adapted)\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors $\\vec{v_1}, \\vec{v_2}, ..., \\vec{v_n}$ are **Avos-independent** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_1 \\otimes \\vec{v_1} \\oplus c_2 \\otimes \\vec{v_2} \\oplus ... \\oplus c_n \\otimes \\vec{v_n} = \\vec{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "implies all $c_i = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight: No Cancellation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since avos_sum is the non-zero minimum:\n",
    "- `a ⊕ b = 0` **only if** both `a = 0` AND `b = 0`\n",
    "- You cannot \"cancel\" non-zero values (there's no subtraction)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **any set of non-zero vectors satisfies the zero-combination test**—you cannot produce $\\vec{0}$ from non-zero vectors with non-zero scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Useful: Ancestry Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "In the genealogical context, a richer notion of independence emerges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ancestry-dependent**: Vector $\\vec{u}$ depends on $\\vec{v}$ if $v$'s ancestry is \"contained within\" $u$'s ancestry (i.e., $v$ is an ancestor of $u$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ancestry-independent**: A set of vectors where no vector's subject is an ancestor of another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Siblings are dependent**: Two siblings share identical ancestry (same parents), so their row vectors in $R^+$ are identical except for the self-element. They are ancestry-dependent because they share common ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unrelated individuals are independent**: If two people share no common ancestors, their row vectors have no overlapping non-zero elements (except possibly 0s).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nullspace Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical LA, vectors are independent if the nullspace of matrix $A$ (with vectors as columns) is only $\\{\\vec{0}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Avos structure:\n",
    "- The \"nullspace\" concept applies but is trivial for non-zero vectors\n",
    "- More meaningful: the **reachability structure** determines dependencies\n",
    "- If $R^+_{ij} \\neq 0$, row $i$ \"depends on\" column $j$ (there's a path)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Doesn't Apply Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**: Require field properties (division, additive inverse)\n",
    "- **Determinants**: Require subtraction\n",
    "- **Orthogonality**: No inner product structure with the required properties\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Tropical Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The Avos structure is related to **tropical (min-plus) algebra**:\n",
    "- Both use min for \"addition\"\n",
    "- Both use a different operation for \"multiplication\"\n",
    "- Both form semirings (not rings or fields)\n",
    "- Both have modified notions of linear algebra (tropical linear algebra is an active research area)\n",
