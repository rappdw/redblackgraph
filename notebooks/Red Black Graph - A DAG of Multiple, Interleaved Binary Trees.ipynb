    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When representing relationships such as familial relationships a number of approaches may be utilized including: ad-hoc, general graphs, specialized tables or charts. As I've explored different representations, a specialized graph representation has emerged which both has interesting properties and is able to efficiently provide solutions to problems that arise including relationship calculation, iterative modification of the relationship set, loop detection/prevention, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying model is a directed, acyclic graph of multiple, interleaved binary trees, I designate as \"Red Black Graphs\". The name, Red Black Graph, derives from superficial similarity to Red Black Trees. Red Black Trees are binary trees such that each node has an extra, color bit (red or black). This color bit us used to balance the tree as modifications are made. In a Red Black Graph each vertex also has a an extra, color bit, rather than utilizing the color bit for balancing, the color bit is used to constrain edges between vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A formal definition of Red Black Graphs is provided. Interesting emergent properties are explored. Several applications of the underlying math are provided to illustrate the utility and benefites of using Red Black Graphs to model familial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A Red Black Graph is a directed acyclic graph with the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any given vertex must have a color, either red or black\n",
    "2. Any given vertex can have at most one outbound edge to a vertex of a given color\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships resulting from sexual reproduction can be modeled by a Red Black Graph, arbitrarily assigning vertices that are male as Red and vertices that are female as Black with direction of edges being from the offspring to the parent.  \n",

    "As constructing $R^+$ by instpection is cumbersome for non-trivial cases, I've determined an approach to mathematically derive $R^+$ from $R$. The first step requires defining a transitive relationship function. To illustrate, consider the following case of 3 vertices: $vertex_{a}$, $vertex_{b}$ and $vertex_{c}$. Further, assume that $vertex_{b}$ is related to $vertex_{a}$ as defined by $n_{p}^{a \\rightarrow b}$, $\\pmb{x}$, and that $vertex_{c}$ is related to $vertex_{b}$ by $n_{p}^{b \\rightarrow c}$, $\\pmb{y}$. Therefore $vertex_{c}$ is related to $vertex_{a}$ by some $n_{p}^{a \\rightarrow c}$, $\\pmb{z}$. The transitive realtionship function (named the avos product and designated by $\\lor$) is defined as: $\\pmb{z}=\\pmb{x}\\lor\\pmb{y}$. \n",

If we were to transcribe $vertex_{b}$'s pedigree into the proper place in $vertex_{a}$'s pedigree chart we'd see that $vertex_{c}$ has $n_{p}=19$ in $vertex_{a}$'s pedigree. In other words, $19=4\\lor7$.\n",

The color of the vector is inherent to the vector but not carried as an element. Any consraints due the color are present as if the color were present as an element.

With the observation that symetrically permuting a matrix corresponds to relabeling the vertices of the associated graph, I will show that with an appropriate relabeling of the graph vertices the Red Black graph adjacency matrix is upper triangular, $R^{+_c}$ or canonical form, and that $R^{+_c} = \\mathbf{P} R^+ \\mathbf{P}^\\top$ where $\\mathbf{P}$ is a permutation matrix derived from the count of the vertices in a component, the identity of the encompasing component for a vertex, and the maximum $n_p$ for each vertex. \n",
