    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When representing binary relationships, such as familial relationships, a number of approaches may be utilized including: ad-hoc, general graphs, specialized tables or charts. As I've explored different representations, a specialized mathematical representation has emerged. This mathematical representation is useful as the underpinnings of dynamic graph algorithms for use cases that include graph analysis, relationship calculation, loop detection, loop prevention, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying mathematical model is a directed, acyclic graph of multiple, interleaved binary trees, designated as a Red Black Graph. The name, Red Black Graph, derives from superficial similarity to Red Black Trees. Red Black Trees are binary trees such that each node has an extra, color bit (red or black). This color bit is used to balance the tree as modifications are made. In a Red Black Graph each vertex also has a an extra, color bit, rather than utilizing the color bit for balancing, the color bit is used to constrain edges between vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will provide a formal definition of a Red Black Graph, as well as explore a number of interesting emergent properties. I will also examine several applications of Red Black Graphs to illustrate the utility of using this mathematical model for familial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A Red Black Graph is a network, $\\mathscr{N}$, consiting of a directed graph, $G = (V,E)$, and a relationship function, $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\rightarrow \\{\\mathbb{N}, -1\\}$. Additionally, the following constraints are in place:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any given vertex must have a color, either red or black\n",
    "2. Any given vertex can have at most one outbound edge to a vertex of a given color\n",
    "3. Every vertex has an edge to itself where: \n",
    "$$r(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{v})\\rightarrow \\begin{cases} \n",
    "-1, & \\text{if }{\\mathbf{v}}\\text{ is a red vertex}, \\\\\n",
    "1, & \\text{if }\\mathbf{v}\\text{ is a black vertex}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "4. If there is no path in $G$ from $\\mathbf{u}$ to $\\mathbf{v}$, $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "5. For all other $\\mathbf{u}$, $\\mathbf{v}$ not covered by constraints 3 and 4, $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\rightarrow x$, were x is generated by walking the shortest path (assume uniform edge weights) from $\\mathbf{u}$ to $\\mathbf{v}$ as follows:\n",
    "  1. $x\\leftarrow 1$\n",
    "  2. walk the edge along the shortest path and update $x$ as follows ($\\ll$ is bitwise shift left): $$x \\leftarrow \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  x \\ll 0, & \\text{if resultant vertex is red}, \\\\\n",
    "  x \\ll 1, & \\text{if resultant vertex is black}\n",
    "  \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "  3. repeat B and terminate after $\\mathbf{v}$ is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships resulting from sexual reproduction can be modeled by a Red Black Graph, arbitrarily assigning vertices that are male as Red and vertices that are female as Black with direction of edges being from the offspring to the parent.  \n",

Slightly more formally, for $G$ with a vertex set $V$, the adjacency matrix is a square $|V|$ x $|V|$ matrix, $A$, such that $A_{ij}$ is $1$ if there exists an edge from $\\mathbf{i}$ to $\\mathbf{j}$ and $0$ otherwise.\n",

I'll define the function, $f(r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}),r(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}))\\rightarrow r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{w})$, as the *avos product* and designate it using $\\star$, e.g. $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{w})=r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) \\star r(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w})$.\n",

Using either the defintion of $r$ or transcribing $\\mathbf{v}$'s pedigree into the proper place in $\\mathbf{u}$'s pedigree chart we see that $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{w})=19$, or $19 = 4 \\star 7$.

As, aside from $-1$, the range of $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})$ is $\\mathbb{N}$, it is natural to utilize unsigned numeric types (in a strongly typed language).

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Having provided a formal definition for a Red Black Graph, looked at its adjacency matrix, $R$, the transitive closure of its adjacency matrix, $R^+$, and the avos sum and product, let's extend these observations into a more general discussion of how principles of linear algebra can be applied to Red Black Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Classes\n",
    "Within the context of a Red Black Graph and its matrix representations, $R$ and $R^+$, the following vector classes are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *row* vector - represented as $\\vec{\\mathbf{u}}$. These vectors represent ancestry for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are constrained to whole numbers and -1 where any number, aside from 0, may appear in an alement at most once and where either -1 or 1 must appear as an element but not both. \n",
    "* *column* vector - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}$. These vectors represent descendency for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are constrained to whole numbers and -1 where either -1 or 1 must appear as an element but not both. Futhermore if -1 appears as an element any further non-zero integer elements must be even and if 1 appears as an element any further non-zero integer elements must be odd.\n",
    "* *simple row vector* - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{u}_{s}}$. Row vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate ancestry only.\n",
    "* *simple column vector* - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{v}_{s}}$. Column vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate descendency only.\n",
    "* *closed row vector* - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{u}_{c}}$. Row vectors from $R^+$. These represent the complete ancestry for a given vertex.\n",
    "* *closed column vector* - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{v}_{c}}$. Column vectors from $R^+$. These represent the complete descendency for a given vertex.\n",
    "* *compositional vectors* - represented by $\\vec{\\mathbf{u}^{c}_{s}}$ or $\\vec{\\mathbf{v}^{c}_{s}}$. Compositional vectors conform to the constrainst of simple row or column vectors with the following additional constraint: neiter 1 nor -1 appear as an element. The color of the vector is inherent to the vector but not carried as an element. Any consraints due the color are present as if the color were present as an element. Color, if significant, is represented notationally by replacing the supersscript $c$ with the color designation, either $r$ or $b$.\n",

    "Consider the case of adding a new vertex to a red black graph. The new vertex, $\\lambda$, may introduce edges to/from vertices in the graph and the corresponding row/column vectors conform to the compositional vector classes defined above. Specifically if adding a red vertex to the graph, the vectors $\\mathbf{u}^{r}_{\\lambda,s}$ and $\\mathbf{v}^{r}_{\\lambda,s}$ define the composition, or if adding a black vertex to the graph, the vectors $\\mathbf{u}^{b}_{\\lambda,s}$ and $\\mathbf{v}^{b}_{\\lambda,s}$ define the composition. These compositional vectors have non-zero elements only for immediate ancestry/descendency. The operation of adding a new vertex to a graph is designated the \"vertex relational composition\" and is defined where $R^+$ is a square matrix of dimension $N$ and $R_{\\lambda}^+$ is a square matrix of dimension $N + 1$ and the colors of $\\vec{\\mathbf{u}^{c}_{\\lambda,s}}$ and $\\vec{\\mathbf{v}^{c}_{\\lambda,s}}$ must be the same.

Appending the complete compositional vectors to $R^+$ isn't sufficient to compose $R_{\\lambda}^+$.

    "Returning to the example, it is obvious from inspection that one component consists of 4 nodes, the other of 3 and that the diamter of the larger component is 2, while the diamter of the smaller is 1. As this information is readily available in the Red Black Graph, it is easily added to the $find\\_components$ algorithm (see the following $find\\_components\\_extended$ algorithm). Observe thatsymetrically permuting a matrix corresponds to relabeling the vertices of the associated graph. I will show that with an appropriate relabeling of the graph vertices the Red Black graph adjacency matrix is upper triangular, $R^{+_c}$ or canonical form. I will also show that $R^{+_c} = \\mathbf{P} R^+ \\mathbf{P}^\\top$ where $\\mathbf{P}$ is a permutation matrix derived from the count of the vertices in a component. $\\mathbf{P}$ will be chosen such that $R^{+_c}$ in addition to being upper triangular, each graph component and its diameter is readily identified.\n",

The vertices are then labeled based on this sorting, e.g. the $zero^{th}$ vertex is the vetex from the largest connected component that has the greatest $r(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})$ (or most distant ancestor) on down to the $n^{th}$ vertex which is the vertex from the smallest connected component with no (or nearest) ancestor. (Ordering is arbitrary for vertices with identical sort keys.)\n",

    "The Red-Black Graph (RBG) formalism—directed acyclic graphs with per-vertex colors and the restriction of at most one outgoing edge per color—intersects with several established areas of graph theory and applied data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multitrees.**  \n",
    "Multitrees are DAGs in which the reachable subgraph from any node is a tree, or equivalently, there exists at most one directed path between any pair of vertices. They have been studied as a way to capture overlapping hierarchies while avoiding cycles. Like RBGs, multitrees are motivated by the need to embed multiple trees into a single DAG, though multitrees do not enforce per-color outdegree constraints ([definition on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitree)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple-tree DAG representations.**  \n",
    "The information visualization community has explored representing multiple classification trees within a single DAG to expose overlaps and differences. For example, Graham and Kennedy’s *Exploring Multiple Trees through DAG Representations* (IEEE TVCG, 2007) develops techniques to merge and visualize multiple tree structures simultaneously ([DOI link](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70536)). This closely parallels the “interleaved binary trees” intuition behind RBGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polyhierarchies and ontologies.**  \n",
    "Applied ontologies such as [SNOMED CT](https://www.snomed.org/) are routinely modeled as DAGs to accommodate multiple inheritance, where a concept can belong to several hierarchies simultaneously. These “polyhierarchies” resonate with the RBG aim of combining multiple overlapping tree structures into a unified directed acyclic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automata and color-constrained graphs.**  \n",
    "In automata theory, deterministic finite automata ([DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)) impose the invariant that from each state there is at most one outgoing edge per input symbol. This is formally analogous to the RBG rule of at most one outgoing edge per color. When minimized, such automata become DAGs (DAFSAs) representing large sets of strings compactly. Similarly, work on [edge-colored digraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_coloring) and alternating or properly colored paths addresses reachability under color constraints, though without the structural tree embedding that RBGs enforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared substructure DAGs.**  \n",
    "Several canonical data structures demonstrate the compression of multiple trees into DAGs. Directed Acyclic Word Graphs ([DAWGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton)) merge tries by sharing suffixes, producing a minimal DAG that encodes many overlapping word trees. Binary Decision Diagrams ([BDDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram)) and their multi-valued generalizations collapse isomorphic subtrees of decision trees into compact DAGs. These approaches are structurally similar to the RBG motivation of compactly encoding multiple interleaved trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain-specific analogues.**  \n",
    "In population genetics, ancestral recombination graphs ([ARGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_recombination_graph)) model how a sequence of local genealogical trees are joined into a global DAG through recombination events. While the semantics differ, ARGs exemplify how multiple tree topologies can coexist within a single DAG framework.\n",

    "**Summary.**  \n",
    "The Red-Black Graph lies at the intersection of multitree theory, color-constrained digraphs, and DAG-based compression of tree families. Its unique contribution is combining (a) interleaving of multiple binary trees, (b) per-vertex color assignments, and (c) a constraint of at most one outgoing edge per color, together with algebraic tools for analyzing relationships via adjacency and closure matrices. This combination does not appear in prior graph-theoretic literature, though it is thematically aligned with several strands of work in automata, ontologies, and data structure compression.\n"
