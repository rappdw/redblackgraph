    "# Linear Algebra of Red Black Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have provided a formal definition for a Red Black Graph, looked at the adjacency matrix and it's transitive closure. We've discussed *pedigree numbers* and the *avos* product for scalers and looked at a number of interesting properites derived. We'll now extend these observations into a more general discussion of how principles of linear algebra can be applied to Red Black Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Classes\n",
    "Within the context of a Red Black Graph and it's adjacency matrix, we define the following vector classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *row* vector - represented by $\\vec u$. These vectors represent ancestry for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are constrained to all positive integers, 0 and 1. Any non-zero integer may appear in an element at most once. \n",
    "* *column* vector - represented by $\\vec v$. These vectors represent descendency for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are also constrained to all positive integers, 0 and 1. Furthermore if the vertex is red, they are constrained to even numbers and -1, if the vertex is black, they are constrained to odd numbers (plus zero). 1 or -1 may appear only once, otherwise there are no constraints. \n",
    "* *simple row vector* - represented by $\\vec u_{s}$. Row vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate ancestry only.\n",
    "* *simple column vector* - represented by $\\vec v_{s}$. Column vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate descendency only.\n",
    "* *closed row vector* - represented by $\\vec u_{c}$. Row vectors from $A_{rb}^+$. These represent the complete ancestry for a given vertex.\n",
    "* *closed column vector* - represented by $\\vec v_{c}$. Column vectors from $A_{rb}^+$. These represent the complete descendency for a given vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *avos* Product for Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider what an *avos* product might represent. Given a row vector and a column vector, we'll define the *avos* product to yield the *pedigree number* representing the relationship between the vertices representing the row and column vectors respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Red Black adjacency matrix from our prior example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "-1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & -1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming 0 indexing in the tha matrix, the 4th row vector is a simple row vector for $vertex_{4}$ while the 2nd column vector is simple column for $vertex_{2}$. It is trivally observable that that $vertex_{4}$ is related to $vertex_{2}$ (by *pedigree number* 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "\\cdot\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "3 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "1 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "= 5\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector dot product, summing element-wise products, results in a scaler value of 6. Element wise *avos* product does in fact yield *pedigree number* that represents a relationship. However, it is possible for there to be multiple paths through the graph bewteen two nodes. If that were the case, summing the element-wise *avos* product would not result in the *pedigree number* representing the relationship from $vertex_{a}$ to $vertex_{c}$. For the *avos* vector product, rather than summing the element-wise *avos* products we arbitrarily choos the non-zero minimum element-wise product, thus representing the \"closest\" relationship between $vertex_{a}$ and $vertex_{c}$.\n",

    "Let's consider how we might add a vertex to the graph that is not currently represented in the grapn and how we might update $A_{rb}^+$ as a result of the vertex addition. In order to introduce a vetex, $\\lambda$, into the graph, that vertex may connect to edges and may also have edges connect to it. This is represented by $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ for that vertex. Note however, that if $A_{rb}^+$ has dimension **N x N**, then $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ have dimension **N + 1**, where the final element for either $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ will either be -1 or 1 depending on whether the added vertex is red or black. Finally, we'll denote $A_{\\lambda, rb}^+$ as the transitive closure of the Red Black adjacency matrix of $A_{rb}$ with vetex $\\lambda$ added. We'll represent this notationally by:\n",
    "\n",

If we remove the final element of $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ and apply this observation and then add in the final element to the resulting vectors, the result is $\\vec v_{\\lambda, c}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, c}$. The complete row and column vectors can be appended as a new row and column respectively to $A_{rb}^+$ (think Numpy hstack and vstack operation). This new matrix is not yet quite what we are looking for. In order to ensure that it is transitively closed we need to examine each existing row and for each element where $\\vec v_{\\lambda, c}$ is non-zero, we need to update the element in the given row to the *avos* product of the column element in $\\vec v_{\\lambda, c}$ and the row element of the corresponding row in $\\vec u_{\\lambda, c}$.\n",
