    "Writing a Numpy extension was undertaken for several purposes including: speeding up the simple python implementation, understanding Numpy internals better (as I use this in my day job), and simply learning. This notebook documents a number of things to be aware of that I haven't been able to find in a concise location or tutorial\n",

    "Unless you are going to do a drop-dead simple implementation including supporting a single Numpy dtype, the very first thing you'll want to do is to conform to the Numpy setup conventions. Admittedly, I simply copied the setup.py from a clone of the Numpy repository and sliced and stitched to satisfy my needs. The germain portions really are defining the extension configurations as seen in the following snippet."
