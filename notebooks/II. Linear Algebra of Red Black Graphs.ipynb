    "# Linear Algebra of Red Black Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have provided a formal definition for a Red Black Graph, looked at the adjacency matrix and it's transitive closure. We've discussed *pedigree numbers* and the *avos* product for scalers and looked at a number of interesting properites derived. We'll now extend these observations into a more general discussion of how principles of linear algebra can be applied to Red Black Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Classes\n",
    "Within the context of a Red Black Graph and it's adjacency matrix, we define the following vector classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *row* vector - represented by $\\vec u$. These vectors represent ancestry for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are constrained to all positive integers, 0 and 1. Any non-zero integer may appear in an element at most once. \n",
    "* *column* vector - represented by $\\vec v$. These vectors represent descendency for a given vertex. Values for elements in these vectors are also constrained to all positive integers, 0 and 1. Furthermore if the vertex is red, they are constrained to even numbers and -1, if the vertex is black, they are constrained to odd numbers (plus zero). 1 or -1 may appear only once, otherwise there are no constraints. \n",
    "* *simple row vector* - represented by $\\vec u_{s}$. Row vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate ancestry only.\n",
    "* *simple column vector* - represented by $\\vec v_{s}$. Column vectors for which elements are constrained to {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. These represent a given vertex and it's immediate descendency only.\n",
    "* *closed row vector* - represented by $\\vec u_{c}$. Row vectors from $A_{rb}^+$. These represent the complete ancestry for a given vertex.\n",
    "* *closed column vector* - represented by $\\vec v_{c}$. Column vectors from $A_{rb}^+$. These represent the complete descendency for a given vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *avos* Product for Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider what an *avos* product might represent. Given a row vector and a column vector, we'll define the *avos* product to yield the *pedigree number* representing the relationship between the vertices representing the row and column vectors respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Red Black adjacency matrix from our prior example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "-1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & -1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming 0 indexing in the tha matrix, the 4th row vector is a simple row vector for $vertex_{4}$ while the 2nd column vector is simple column for $vertex_{2}$. It is trivally observable that that $vertex_{4}$ is related to $vertex_{2}$ (by *pedigree number* 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",

    "1 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "= 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector dot product, summing element-wise products, results in a scaler value of 6. Element wise *avos* product does in fact yield *pedigree number* that represents a relationship. However, it is possible for there to be multiple paths through the graph bewteen two nodes. If that were the case, summing the element-wise *avos* product would not result in the *pedigree number* representing the relationship from $vertex_{a}$ to $vertex_{c}$. For the *avos* vector product, rather than summing the element-wise *avos* products we arbitrarily choos the non-zero minimum element-wise product, thus representing the \"closest\" relationship between $vertex_{a}$ and $vertex_{c}$.\n",

    "Consider adding a vertex to the graph that is not currently represented and how we might update $A_{rb}^+$ as a result of the vertex addition. In order to introduce a vetex, $\\lambda$, into the graph, that vertex may connect to edges and may also have edges connect to it. This is represented by $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$, a row vector that captures direct edges from $\\lambda$ to existing vertices, and $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$, a column vector that captures direct edges from existing vertices to $\\lambda$. Note however, that if $A_{rb}^+$ has dimension **N x N**, then $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ have dimension **N + 1**, where the final element for either $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ will either be -1 or 1 depending on whether the added vertex is red or black. Finally, we'll denote $A_{\\lambda, rb}^+$ as the transitive closure of the Red Black adjacency matrix of $A_{rb}$ with vetex $\\lambda$ added. We'll represent this notationally by:\n",

If we remove the final element of $\\vec v_{\\lambda, s}$ and $\\vec u_{\\lambda, s}$ and apply this observation and then add in the final element to the resulting vectors, the result is $\\vec u_{\\lambda, c}$ and $\\vec v_{\\lambda, c}$.

Let's look at the $bfg$ term. $b$ represents the relationship from $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$, $f$ represents the relationship from $\\beta$ to $\\gamma$ and $g$ represents the relationship from $\\gamma$ to $\\alpha$.
