    "Before formally defining vector addition, consider the example motivating this. Each vector (assuming a row vector here) represents a person and their complete ancestry. As such it is easy to imagine that vector addition represents one of two cases:\n",
    "1. The resulting ancestry for the offspring of $\\vec{\\alpha}$ and $\\vec{\\beta}$\n",
    "2. The resulting ancestry of adding $\\vec{\\beta}$ as an immediate ancester (or distant ancester for that matter) of $\\vec{\\alpha}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, recall that each vector will either be *red* (has one and only one element with value of $-1$) or *black* (has one and only one element with value of $1$). I designate this the \"self element\" and use $v_s$ to notationally represent the self element for a given vector $\\vec{v}$. Finally, $u_{s_v}$, represents the element in $\\vec{u}$ that is the \"self element\" in $\\vec{v}$.\n",
