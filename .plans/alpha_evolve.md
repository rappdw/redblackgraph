## Alternative Approaches (Without Direct AlphaEvolve Access)

If Early Access Program is delayed or unavailable:

### DIY Evolutionary Framework

**Inspired by AlphaEvolve's Approach:**

```python
# Simplified evolutionary algorithm for AVOS operations
class DIYAlphaEvolve:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, evaluator):
        self.llm = llm_client  # Use Gemini API
        self.evaluator = evaluator
        self.population = []
        
    def evolve(self, num_iterations=100):
        # 1. Initial population from LLM
        self.population = self.generate_initial_programs()
        
        for iteration in range(num_iterations):
            # 2. Evaluate fitness
            scored_programs = [(p, self.evaluator.evaluate(p)) 
                              for p in self.population]
            
            # 3. Select best performers
            elite = self.select_elite(scored_programs)
            
            # 4. Generate mutations via LLM
            mutations = self.mutate_with_llm(elite)
            
            # 5. Update population
            self.population = elite + mutations
```

**Benefits:**
