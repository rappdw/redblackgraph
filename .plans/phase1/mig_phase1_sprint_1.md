## Testing Requirements

### Validation Tests
- Build current codebase in all Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 environments
- Run existing test suite to establish baseline
- Verify benchmark script produces consistent results

### Documentation Review
- Peer review of all documentation deliverables
- Ensure reproducibility of setup instructions

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Dependencies**: None - this is the foundation sprint

**Potential Blockers**:
- Access to Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 installations
- CI/CD system access (for baseline capture)
- Sufficient hardware for performance benchmarking

---

## Communication & Reporting

**Daily Standup Topics**:
- Progress on environment setup
- Issues encountered with baseline capture
- Any surprises in code inventory

**Sprint Review Demo**:
- Show all three Python environments working
- Present baseline report
- Walk through code inventory
- Demonstrate benchmark script

**Sprint Retrospective Focus**:
- Was baseline comprehensive enough?
- Are we ready for dependency updates?
- Any gaps in documentation?

---

## Next Sprint Preview

**Sprint 2** will focus on:
- Updating dependency files (setup.py, requirements.txt)
- Updating Python version classifiers
- Removing obsolete dependencies
- Testing build process with new dependencies

**Preparation for Sprint 2**:
- Review dependency update strategy
- Ensure understanding of semantic versioning
- Familiarize with numpy.distutils (still in use for Phase 1)

---

## Notes

- This sprint is intentionally conservative to ensure solid foundation
- All documentation created here will be referenced throughout Phase 1
- Performance baseline is critical for validating later changes
- Code inventory prevents surprises in later sprints

**Status**: Ready to start
