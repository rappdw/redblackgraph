# Phase 1 Migration: Sprint Overview

**Phase Goal**: Establish a stable baseline with modern dependencies (Python 3.10+, NumPy 1.26, SciPy 1.11) while maintaining numpy.distutils compatibility.

**Total Duration**: 12-16 days (2.5-3 weeks)  
**Team Size**: 2-3 engineers + QA  
**Complexity**: Low to Medium

---

## Sprint Structure

Phase 1 has been decomposed into **4 self-contained sprints**, each building upon the previous:

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Baseline Establishment
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Focus**: Setup and documentation  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Development environments for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Git branch strategy (`phase1-upgrade`)
- Current state baseline (tests, performance, code inventory)
- Risk assessment

**Why First**: Establishes the foundation and baseline metrics for comparison throughout Phase 1.

---

### Sprint 2: Dependency Updates
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Focus**: Update version specifications  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Updated setup.py files (all packages)
- Updated requirements.txt files
- Updated Python classifiers
- Build validation across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Wheel building verification

**Why Second**: Changes are straightforward but critical; must be stable before code modernization.

---

### Sprint 3: Code Modernization & Cleanup
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Focus**: Code updates for Python 3.10+ and NumPy 1.26  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Removed dataclasses backport
- Fixed NumPy 1.26 deprecation warnings
- Modernized Python 3.10+ code patterns
- Updated C/Cython extensions
- Code quality improvements

**Why Third**: Requires stable dependency base from Sprint 2; involves most code changes.

---

### Sprint 4: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Focus**: Thorough testing and release preparation  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Full test matrix execution (all Python versions × platforms)
- Performance validation against baseline
- Integration and edge case testing
- Memory leak testing
- Release-ready artifacts and documentation

**Why Fourth**: Final validation before merge; most QA-intensive sprint.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Underestimating NumPy 1.26 Changes
**Symptoms**: Many unexpected deprecation warnings in Sprint 3  
**Avoidance**: Review NumPy 1.26 release notes early in Sprint 1  
**Mitigation**: Budget extra time in Sprint 3 for deprecation fixes

### Pitfall 2: Platform-Specific Issues
**Symptoms**: Tests pass on Linux but fail on macOS  
**Avoidance**: Test on both platforms in Sprint 2  
**Mitigation**: Have platform-specific expertise available

### Pitfall 3: Dependency Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Can't install compatible versions of NumPy/SciPy  
**Avoidance**: Check compatibility before Sprint 2  
**Mitigation**: Adjust version constraints as needed

### Pitfall 4: Scope Creep
**Symptoms**: Adding features or optimizations during Phase 1  
**Avoidance**: Strict focus on migration goals only  
**Mitigation**: Defer enhancements to Phase 2 or later

### Pitfall 5: Insufficient Testing
**Symptoms**: Issues discovered after merge  
**Avoidance**: Comprehensive Sprint 4 testing  
**Mitigation**: Add tests as issues are discovered

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Sprint-Level Rollback
If a sprint fails:
1. Identify problematic commits
2. Revert to previous sprint's stable state
3. Analyze failure
4. Adjust approach
5. Retry sprint

### Phase-Level Rollback
If Phase 1 needs complete rollback:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch phase1-upgrade-failed phase1-upgrade
git branch -D phase1-upgrade
# Return to planning
```

**Decision Criteria for Rollback**:
- Critical bugs that can't be fixed quickly
- Fundamental incompatibility discovered
- Performance regression >20%
- Team consensus that approach is flawed
