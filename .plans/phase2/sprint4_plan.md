# Sprint 4: Python 3.12 Testing

## Objective
Validate all 117 tests pass on Python 3.12 using Meson-built extensions

## Strategy
1. Use builddir with PYTHONPATH for testing (avoids editable install issues)
2. Run full test suite from outside source directory
3. Validate all extensions work correctly
4. Compare results with Phase 1 baseline (117/117 tests)

## Success Criteria
- All 9 extensions import successfully
- 117/117 tests pass on Python 3.12
- No regressions from Phase 1
- Performance validation
