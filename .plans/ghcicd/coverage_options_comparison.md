# Coverage Reporting Options Comparison

This document compares different code coverage reporting solutions for the GitHub Actions migration.

## Overview

When migrating from Travis CI + Codecov, you need to choose how to handle coverage reporting in GitHub Actions. This document compares three main options.

## Quick Recommendation

**For easiest migration**: Continue with Codecov (Option A)

**For minimal dependencies**: GitHub Native Coverage (Option B)

**For feature parity with Codecov**: Coveralls (Option C)

## Detailed Comparison

### Option A: Codecov (Recommended)

#### What is it?
Continue using Codecov.io with the official GitHub Action.

#### Pros
‚úÖ **Minimal migration effort** - Same service, just different integration  
‚úÖ **Feature-rich** - Pull request comments, coverage diffs, sunburst charts  
‚úÖ **Familiar interface** - Team already knows how to use it  
‚úÖ **Good GitHub integration** - Native PR comments and checks  
‚úÖ **Free for open source** - No cost for public repositories  
‚úÖ **Historical data** - Maintains continuity with existing coverage history  
‚úÖ **Multiple language support** - If you expand beyond Python  
‚úÖ **Badge support** - Same badges work with minimal changes  

#### Cons
‚ùå **External dependency** - Relies on third-party service  
‚ùå **Potential service outages** - If Codecov is down, coverage upload fails  
‚ùå **Account management** - Requires Codecov account and token management  
‚ùå **Privacy considerations** - Coverage data stored externally  

#### Implementation

**Workflow snippet:**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest --cov=redblackgraph \
           --cov-report=xml \
           --cov-report=term-missing

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml
    flags: unittests
    name: codecov-py${{ matrix.python-version }}
    fail_ci_if_error: false
    verbose: true
```

**Required setup:**
- Codecov account (already exists for this project)
- No token needed for public repos (uses GitHub OIDC)
- For private repos: Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret

**Badge update:**
```markdown
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/rappdw/redblackgraph/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rappdw/redblackgraph)
```
*No change needed!*

#### Estimated migration effort
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Risk**: Very Low

### Option B: GitHub Native Coverage

#### What is it?
Use GitHub Actions artifacts and comments for coverage reporting, with optional third-party actions for visualization.

#### Pros
‚úÖ **No external dependencies** - Everything within GitHub  
‚úÖ **Simple setup** - No account management  
‚úÖ **Fast** - No upload to external service  
‚úÖ **Privacy** - Data stays in your repository  
‚úÖ **Free** - Part of GitHub Actions  
‚úÖ **Customizable** - Full control over display  

#### Cons
‚ùå **Less feature-rich** - Basic coverage display  
‚ùå **No dedicated UI** - Limited visualization  
‚ùå **Manual setup** - More configuration needed  
‚ùå **Limited history** - Artifacts expire after 90 days  
‚ùå **No coverage diff** - Won't show coverage changes in PRs (without extra work)  
‚ùå **Badge complexity** - Requires Gist or other workaround  

#### Implementation

**Option B1: Artifacts Only (Simplest)**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest --cov=redblackgraph \
           --cov-report=html \
           --cov-report=term-missing

- name: Upload coverage HTML
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: htmlcov/
```

**Option B2: PR Comments (Better UX)**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest --cov=redblackgraph \
           --cov-report=xml \
           --cov-report=term-missing | tee coverage.txt

- name: Coverage comment
  uses: py-cov-action/python-coverage-comment-action@v3
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

**Option B3: Summary (Best Native Option)**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest --cov=redblackgraph --cov-report=xml

- name: Code Coverage Summary Report
  uses: irongut/CodeCoverageSummary@v1.3.0
  with:
    filename: coverage.xml
    badge: true
    format: markdown
    output: both

- name: Add to Job Summary
  run: cat code-coverage-results.md >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

**Badge setup (complex):**
Requires creating a Gist and using shields.io:
```markdown
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/GIST_ID/raw/coverage.json)](https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph/actions)
```

#### Estimated migration effort
- **Time**: 4-8 hours (includes badge setup)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Medium (testing needed for PR workflow)

---

### Option C: Coveralls

#### What is it?
Coveralls.io - A Codecov alternative with similar features.

#### Pros
‚úÖ **Feature-rich** - Similar to Codecov  
‚úÖ **Good GitHub integration** - PR comments, checks  
‚úÖ **Free for open source**  
‚úÖ **Mature service** - Well-established  
‚úÖ **Good documentation**  

#### Cons
‚ùå **External dependency** - Another service to depend on  
‚ùå **Account setup needed** - New service to sign up for  
‚ùå **Badge change required** - New URL for badges  
‚ùå **No historical data** - Starts fresh (loses Codecov history)  
‚ùå **Learning curve** - Team needs to learn new interface  

#### Implementation

**Workflow snippet:**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest --cov=redblackgraph --cov-report=lcov

- name: Upload to Coveralls
  uses: coverallsapp/github-action@v2
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    path-to-lcov: coverage.lcov
```

**Required setup:**
- Create Coveralls account
- Link GitHub repository
- No token needed for public repos

**Badge update:**
```markdown
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/rappdw/redblackgraph/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/rappdw/redblackgraph?branch=master)
```

#### Estimated migration effort
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Risk**: Low

## Decision Framework

### Choose Codecov if:
- ‚úÖ You want the easiest migration
- ‚úÖ You like the current Codecov features
- ‚úÖ Your team is already familiar with Codecov
- ‚úÖ You want to maintain historical coverage data
- ‚úÖ You don't mind external dependencies

### Choose GitHub Native if:
- ‚úÖ You want zero external dependencies
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with more manual setup
- ‚úÖ You prioritize data privacy/control
- ‚úÖ You don't need advanced coverage features
- ‚úÖ You're willing to invest in custom solutions

### Choose Coveralls if:
- ‚úÖ You want to try something different from Codecov
- ‚úÖ You like feature-rich coverage tools
- ‚úÖ You don't mind external dependencies
- ‚úÖ You want similar features to Codecov with a different provider

## Hybrid Approach

You can also use multiple approaches:

**Example: Codecov + GitHub Artifacts**
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml

- name: Upload coverage HTML artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: htmlcov/
```

Benefits:
- Best of both worlds
- Redundancy if one service fails
- HTML artifacts for local inspection

## Recommendation Summary

**For redblackgraph project:**

üèÜ **Primary Recommendation: Option A (Codecov)**

**Rationale:**
1. Minimal migration effort (fastest path to GitHub Actions)
2. Team already familiar with the interface
3. Maintains historical coverage data
4. No badge changes needed
5. All features currently used will continue working
6. Can always switch later if needed

**Alternative:** If you want to eliminate external dependencies in the future, start with Codecov for quick migration, then evaluate switching to GitHub Native in Phase 4 (Cleanup).

## Testing Your Choice

Before committing to a coverage solution, test it:

1. **Create a test branch**
2. **Implement chosen solution**
3. **Run 5-10 commits with CI**
4. **Evaluate:**
   - Is coverage accurate?
   - Is the workflow reliable?
   - Is the UX acceptable?
   - Are there any issues?

## Migration Timeline Impact

| Option | Added Timeline |
|--------|----------------|
| Codecov | +0 days |
| GitHub Native | +1-2 days |
| Coveralls | +0.5-1 day |
