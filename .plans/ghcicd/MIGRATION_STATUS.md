## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

### 1. Set Up Coverage Badge (15 minutes) ⚠️ REQUIRED
Without this, the coverage badge job will fail on master/main branches.

**Follow**: [badge_setup_guide.md](./badge_setup_guide.md)

**Steps**:
1. Create GitHub Personal Access Token (gist scope)
2. Create public Gist for coverage data
3. Add two secrets to repository:
   - `GIST_SECRET` - Your personal access token
   - `COVERAGE_GIST_ID` - Your Gist ID

**Note**: This can be done after creating the feature branch, but must be done before merging to master.

### 2. Create Feature Branch (2 minutes)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/github-actions-ci
git add .github/ .plans/ghcicd/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

- Migrate from Travis CI to GitHub Actions
- Use GitHub native coverage instead of Codecov
- Add CI, integration test, and release workflows
- Include comprehensive migration documentation"
git push -u origin feature/github-actions-ci
```

### 3. Verify Workflows (30-60 minutes)
After pushing:
1. Go to https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph/actions
2. Verify CI workflow triggers automatically
3. Check all jobs pass:
   - ✅ Lint job
   - ✅ Test jobs (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
   - ⏭️ Coverage badge job (skips on feature branches - expected)
4. Download and inspect coverage artifacts
5. Review build times vs Travis CI

### 4. Create Pull Request (15 minutes)
Create PR to test:
- PR comment with coverage summary
- Branch protection compatibility
- Full workflow execution

**Don't merge yet** - This starts Phase 2 (Parallel Testing)

## 🔄 Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create workflow directory structure
- [x] Implement CI workflow with native coverage
- [x] Create integration test workflow
- [x] Create release workflow
- [x] Create documentation
- [ ] Test workflows on feature branch ⬅️ **NEXT**

### Phase 2: Parallel Operation (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Run both Travis CI and GitHub Actions
- [ ] Monitor and compare results
- [ ] Track metrics (build times, success rates)
- [ ] Address any issues found
- [ ] Build team confidence

### Phase 3: Cutover (1 week)
- [ ] Update README badges
- [ ] Configure branch protection
- [ ] Disable Travis CI
- [ ] Announce to team

### Phase 4: Cleanup (1 week)
- [ ] Archive .travis.yml
- [ ] Optimize workflows
- [ ] Final documentation updates

## 🎨 Key Features of GitHub Actions Implementation

### CI Workflow Highlights
- **Matrix Testing**: All supported Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- **Native Coverage**: No external dependencies (Codecov was deactivated)
- **PR Comments**: Automatic coverage summaries on pull requests
- **Job Summaries**: Rich coverage reports in GitHub UI
- **Artifact Storage**: 30-day retention for coverage reports
- **Smart Caching**: Pip packages cached per Python version
- **Fail Under 65%**: Enforces existing coverage requirement

### Coverage Reporting
- **Tool**: irongut/CodeCoverageSummary action
- **Badge**: Dynamic Gist-based badge via shields.io
- **Thresholds**: Red < 65%, Yellow 65-79%, Green ≥ 80%
- **Outputs**: XML, HTML, and terminal reports
- **PR Integration**: Sticky comments on pull requests

### Integration Tests
- **Schedule**: Weekly (Sundays at 2 AM UTC)
- **Trigger**: Manual dispatch or push to develop
- **Support**: `--slow` flag for longer tests
- **Same Matrix**: Consistent with CI workflow

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Coverage Badge Setup is Required
The `coverage-badge` job in `ci.yml` requires two secrets:
- `GIST_SECRET`
- `COVERAGE_GIST_ID`

Without these, the job will fail on master/main branches (it's designed to skip on other branches).

### Travis CI Remains Active
During Phase 2 (Parallel Operation):
- Keep `.travis.yml` active
- Both CI systems will run
- Compare results for 2-4 weeks
- Don't disable Travis CI yet

### README Badge Updates
Update badges AFTER:
- Badge secrets are configured
- First successful workflow run on master
- Gist is populated with coverage data

Current badges to replace:
```markdown
# OLD (Travis CI)
[![TravisCI](https://api.travis-ci.org/rappdw/redblackgraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rappdw/redblackgraph)

# NEW (GitHub Actions)
[![CI](https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

```markdown
# OLD (Codecov)
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/rappdw/redblackgraph/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rappdw/redblackgraph)

# NEW (GitHub Native)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rappdw/YOUR_GIST_ID/raw/redblackgraph-coverage.json)](https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### First Workflow Run
When you push the feature branch:
- CI workflow triggers automatically
- Lint job completes in ~2-3 minutes
- Test jobs run in parallel (~5-8 minutes each)
- Coverage reports generated and uploaded
- All jobs should pass ✅

### Coverage Badge Job
On feature branch:
- Job will be skipped (by design)
- Only runs on master/main branches
- Requires secrets to be configured first

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If lint job fails
- Check pylint version compatibility
- Review pylint output in job logs
- May need to adjust .pylintrc

### If test jobs fail
- Check for environment-specific issues
- Verify Meson build succeeds
- Compare with local test runs
- Review pytest output in artifacts

### If coverage is too low
- Current threshold: 65%
- Compare with Travis CI coverage
- Check coverage.cfg settings
- Review excluded files

### If builds are slow
- Review caching configuration
- Check pip install times
- Consider matrix strategy optimization
