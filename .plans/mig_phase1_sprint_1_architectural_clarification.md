## 1. Current State & Testing Infrastructure

### 1.1 Existing Test Coverage

- **Q1.1.3**: Do integration tests exist, or are we primarily working with unit tests? What about end-to-end tests? primarily unit tests
- **Q1.1.4**: Are there any platform-specific tests (Linux vs macOS vs Windows)? Which platforms must we support? Linux and macOS

### 1.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Q1.2.1**: Is Travis CI still the active CI/CD platform, or has the team migrated to GitHub Actions or another platform? Travis is still CI/CD platform.

- **Q1.3.1**: Are there existing performance benchmarks/tests, or do we need to create them from scratch? Don't worry about performance at this time.
- **Q1.3.2**: What are the critical performance-sensitive operations that must be benchmarked? (The sprint mentions matrix operations, sparse matrix operations, csgraph operations, and import times - is this complete?) Don't worry about performance at this time.
- **Q1.3.3**: What is an acceptable performance variance from the baseline? (+/- 5%? +/- 10%?) Don't worry about performance at this time.
